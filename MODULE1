MODULE1 -"BANKING SURVEILLANCE USING IR SENSOR"

ABSTRACT: 
The "Banking Surveillance Using IR Sensor" project presents an innovative approach to enhancing security in banking environments.This system uses an IR sensor
module to detect unauthorized movement or proximity to restricted areas. The circuit employs an IR transmitter and receiver, paired with an LM358 operational
amplifier acting as a comparator.Upon detecting motion or object presence, the system triggers an alert mechanism comprising a buzzer and an LED indicator. 
Designed to be efficient and cost-effective, this solution provides a robust layer of security to deter unauthorized access and enhance monitoring in banks.

INTRODUCTION:
Security is paramount in banking facilities, where financial assets and sensitive data are at risk of theft or breach. Traditional surveillance systems, 
while effective, can be expensive and complex to deploy. This project proposes a simplified yet effective surveillance mechanism using IR sensor technology.
The system works by emitting infrared signals and detecting their reflection when an object or person enters the monitored zone. The compact design, powered by 
a 9V battery, can be easily integrated into restricted areas, vaults, or ATM booths. The visual and auditory alerts provide real-time notifications to security 
personnel, ensuring prompt response to potential threats.

OBJECTIVE:
To design a reliable surveillance system for banking environments using IR sensors.
To detect unauthorized movement or proximity to restricted areas.

SCOPE:
Monitoring unauthorized access to vaults or safes.
Providing real-time alerts for better incident response.

GOALS:
To achieve high accuracy in detecting unauthorized activity.
To ensure enhanced security in bank lockers.

ADVANTAGES:
Enhanced Security: The sensor can detect if someone is too close to the locker, helping to prevent unauthorized access.
Automatic Lock/Unlock: The locker can be programmed to automatically lock or unlock when the sensor detects an object or person nearby.

APPLICATION:
School and Bank Lockers: For automatic or secure locking systems in schools or Banking sector.
Office Storage: To secure personal belongings or sensitive documents.
